# DimensionalPocketsII16x
Minecraft faithful 16x textures for the Dimensional Pockets II mod.

## Rationale
Dimensional Pockets II has native 32x textures as we feel that they allow for that extra bit of detail, whilst not being completely immersion shattering.

Understandably however, many players wish for the mod to be more faithful to Minecraft's art style, hence the existence of this pack.

## Dependencies
This pack requires **Dimensional Pockets II**. Without, this pack will do nothing.
