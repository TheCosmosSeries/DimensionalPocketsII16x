# Dimensional Pockets II 16x Resource Pack

### Introduction
Minecraft faithful 16x textures for the [Dimensional Pockets II](https://github.com/TheCosmosSeries/DimensionalPocketsII) mod.

### Rationale
Dimensional Pockets II has native 32x textures as we feel that they allow for extra detail whilst not being completely immersion shattering.

Understandably however, many players wish for the mod to be more faithful to Minecraft's art style hence the existence of this pack.

### Dependencies
This pack requires **Dimensional Pockets II**. Without which this pack will do _nothing_.
